      <h2>PLOT</h2>
      <p>
        A pair of high school students,{" "}
        <span style={{ fontWeight: "bold" }}>Kei Kurono</span> and{" "}
        <span style={{ fontWeight: "bold" }}>Masaru Kato</span>, are hit by a
        subway train in an attempt to save the life of a drunk homeless man who
        had fallen onto the tracks. Following their deaths, Kurono and Kato find
        themselves transported to the interior of an unfurnished Tokyo
        apartment, where they meet Joichiro Nishi, a Gantz veteran, and other
        clueless participants. The pair soon realizes that they are not allowed
        to leave the apartment. At one end of the room there is a large black
        sphere known as <span style={{ fontWeight: "bold" }}>"Gantz"</span>.
        After some time in the room, the Gantz sphere opens up, revealing a bald
        naked man with a breathing mask and wires attached to his head, and
        various weapons for them to use. These include the custom fitting black
        suits which give them super-human strength, speed, stamina and damage
        resistance, a controller which acts as a radar and stealth unit, X-gun,
        X-Shotgun, Y-Gun. Later on the series the Gantz sword, Gantz Bike are
        made available as well as much more powerful weapons are awarded in the
        100 point menu.
      </p>
      <p>
        {" "}
        When the Gantz sphere opens, green text appears on its surface,
        informing those present that their "lives have ended and now belong to
        him". A picture and brief information is shown of some of the
        <span style={{ fontWeight: "bold" }}> Gantz' targets;</span> Gantz
        orders them to go and kill them. Except for a single mission, all the
        targets are aliens living on Earth, which take on a wide variety of
        forms. During the mission, normal people cannot see the players or the
        aliens. Gantz transports them to the area of the mission, and they
        cannot leave or return until all the enemies have been killed, or the
        time limit has run out. If they survive a successful mission, each
        individual is awarded points for the aliens they have killed. Once a
        participant has scored 100 points, a "100 point menu" will appear. The
        menu offers three options:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          {" "}
          <span style={{ fontWeight: "bold" }}>Option 1:</span> The participant
          can return to their normal life, never having to be summoned by Gantz
          again. As a price, their memories of Gantz and the missions will be
          erased.{" "}
        </li>
        <li>
          <span style={{ fontWeight: "bold" }}>Option 2:</span> The participant
          obtains a unique and extremely powerful weapon.
        </li>
        <li>
          {" "}
          <span style={{ fontWeight: "bold" }}>Option 3:</span> The participant
          can revive someone who has died during a mission from Gantz' memory.
          This option appeared halfway through the series.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        After a mission has been completed, points are tallied up, the
        participants are allowed to leave and do as they see fit until their
        next mission, with the exception of talking about Gantz which would lead
        to their heads exploding. During Kurono and Kato's third mission, all
        the participants including Kato are killed, however Kato kills the last
        boss giving Kurono a chance to survive. Kurono survives the third
        mission bleeding on the floor with his limbs cut apart. After the third
        mission Kurono starts to change inside adopting a hero, leader complex
        similar to Kato. As the series continues, Kurono participates with the
        objective of reviving his deceased friends with the 100 point reward
        option. A new team of Gantz players is assembled, which Kurono leads, as
        the most experienced veteran and one of the best fighters. In the Oni
        mission it is shown that with Kurono's "will to live" he becomes the
        most ferocious Gantz hunter in the team. Through his interactions with
        the other members of the team and his life or death battles, Kurono
        gradually grows into a responsible leader. After the Oni mission Kato is
        revived by Kurono, and soon after Kurono meets his demise against the
        vampires. As the series goes on, the rules of the missions change; they
        can now be seen by regular people, the aliens they encounter are
        increasingly more powerful and dangerous, and they participate in a
        mission with another Gantz team from Osaka. Kato becomes the center of
        attention in the manga and his quest to revive Kurono. In a desperate
        attempt to revive his best friend, Kato fights the one hundred point
        alien Nurarihyon which obliterates both Osaka and Kurono's team. At the
        end of the mission, similar to the first time Kato died, he defeats
        arguably the strongest alien in the series and is laid bleeding on the
        floor. The series depicts both the missions and Kurono's regular life,
        as well as the daily lives of other Gantz players (to a lesser extent).
      </p>

        After several missions, an old participant named Nishi, who knows more
        than the others about how Gantz works, shows them a "catastrophe
        countdown" on the Gantz sphere which the other players were unaware of.
        The countdown reveals that there is one week left until some unknown
        "catastrophe." At the end of that week, a massive alien force invades
        the Earth and begins exterminating the human race, while Kurono and his
        companions try their best to make use of Gantz' advanced technology and
        weaponry in defense. At the end, Nishi and Kurono are depicted to be
        similar, both of whom were despised by their family and were sinister;
        however, unlike Nishi, Kurono has a reason to live. Nishi, in the
        chapter "The Great Escape", is left for dead by Kurono, vowing vengeance
        against him and crying out for Gantz and mother for help. It is hinted
        that Nishi died, but his death seems to be unclear. The Japanese also
        learn of the existence of Gantz teams all around the world. After a long
        battle, the humans manage to stop the alien invasion and soon after, it
        is revealed that it was another, highly advanced alien species that
        provided mankind with the means to defend itself against the invaders,
        for reasons they refuse to reveal, calling it a whim. In a desperate
        last effort, the leader of the alien forces, Eeva, challenges the whole
        human race, promising to exterminate every inhabitant by himself by
        crashing their mother ship, killing both races if Kurono does not come
        to their mother ship to fight him. Prior to this announcement Eeva
        completely dominates all Gantz teams in his vicinity by killing all the
        hunters, giving the human race a sense of their mortality. The world
        calls on Kurono, which is broadcast to the entire world, and, with a
        revived Kato's help, Kurono bets all his chance of winning and saving
        the human race on himself. Kurono manages to defeat Eeva, thus
        preventing the alien mothership from destroying Earth. The series ends
        with Kurono and Kato returning safely to Earth and being greeted as
        heroes.

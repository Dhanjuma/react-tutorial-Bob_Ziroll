          The earliest traces of Clever go back to 2006 via The Gadsden Times,
          revealing that the artist, named Joshua Tyler Huie, is a 34-year-old
          rapper and singer from Gadsden, Alabama. He’s been making music for
          over a decade, appearing on BET’s 106 & Park in 2006 at 21 years old
          to compete on the show’s “Freestyle Fridays” segment. His Facebook
          page reveals an affiliation with Fredwreck, the producer known for his
          work with classic hip-hop acts like Snoop Dogg, Ice Cube, Westside
          Connection, Mobb Deep, and more.

          Clever has released multiple projects throughout his career, although
          much of his early music appears to have been scrubbed from the
          internet. Some Facebook videos remain, and old Facebook posts indicate
          that his currently blank SoundCloud page did once contain music. He
          has a handful of singles on Spotify dating back to 2014. Several full
          albums also appear on his page, although some appear to be by
          different artists with the same name. A 2013 YouTube upload titled
          “Nobody Can Save You” may be his oldest song available on digital
          platforms. It features Funk Volume affiliate SwizZz and has earned
          over 125,000 views.

          Clever’s only other high-profile collaboration is a feature on 2014’s
          “Payday,” a song by Snoop Dogg’s Tha Eastsidaz group that briefly
          reunited that year for the mixtape That’s My Work 4.

          In the ensuing years, Clever’s Facebook page indicates that he’s
          dropped dozens of loosies and covers, many of which are no longer
          available online. In November 2018, a song titled “When Only You Will
          Do” appeared on the YouTube account FCK THEM, the same page that hosts
          6ix9ine and Trippie Redd’s early videos for “GUMMO” and “Poles 1469.”
          It has earned nearly 100,000 views.

          Juice WRLD was seen listening to an unreleased Clever song titled
          “Before I Go” on a private jet back in January, although it’s unclear
          when they first connected. In the last few months, Clever has also
          gained attention thanks to a snippet of his unreleased song,
          “Loyalty,” which his Instagram story reveals will drop next Friday,
          March 15.

          In a recent Facebook post, Clever offered a list of artists and music
          industry players that have reached out to him. <br />
          <br />{" "}
          <p className="quote">
            " Every time I wake up I have a thousand more followers on my
            Instagram 😌 last night Offset hit me up.. last week Quavo was
            calling me. Coach K is hitting me up.. 21 Savage, Lil Baby,
            Timbaland, Lil Skies, Kcamp and many many more have reached out to
            me.. even comedians like Emanuel Hudson and Haha Davis has reached
            out to me and swapped numbers. Lil Bibby shared my post.. and I got

            cranked up"
          </p>{" "}
          <br /> <br />
          It remains to be seen how many of these collaborations will come
          together, but a song with G Herbo does exists. Clever can be heard on
          a snippet the Chicago rapper previewed via Instagram Live in late
          February:

          Clever’s new sound differs from his older content, eschewing
          traditional hip-hop for the emo-infected crooning that artists like
          Juice WRLD are known for.
